# D3Fun

This repo contains some d3 data visuals that I created for various aspects and just for fun. 

d3bargraph.html is a bargraph that uses d3 transitions to animate a growing bar chart


reactiveload.html is the animated arcs in the "animated arcs.html" file mixed in with css3 animation using transitions and jquery to trigger the transistion to make a reactive webpage that uses the d3 donut chart.

Feel free to use any of the content in this repo for your own personal user.

Thank you
